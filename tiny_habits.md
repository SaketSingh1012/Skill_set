### Question 2:

1. Creating new habits requires an understanding of the behavior equation: behavior = motivation + ability + cue.<br>
2. Establish little, quick habits to start with so you don't need as much encouragement to follow them.<br>
3. Action prompts that are triggered by a behavior's accomplishment are more effective than external or internal prompts.<br>
4. Celebrate each minor success by adding a little "shine" to your habit to boost your inspiration and motivation.<br>
5. The ability to adapt and perform more or return to the simplest version is crucial for habit maintenance. Small, persistent habits are most successful.

### Question 3: Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?

After each habit is successfully completed, "shining" or celebrating is important because it promotes positive behavior and offers various advantages that are critical for habit building.

### Question 4: What was the most interesting story or idea for you?

British Cycling's success was fueled by incremental improvements thanks to Dave Brailsford's "1% better" attitude. Small habits add up: 1% everyday success leads to considerable success, while failure stems from decline. Designing your surroundings for positive habits will help you change your behavior. A good place to start is with the "two-minute rule." Immediate rewards help preserve routines; employ the "Seinfeld strategy" to take pleasure in the journey.

### Question 8: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
I'd like to make reading books a habit.
I'll aim to read books about my favorite subject first because doing so will immediately make my brain feel dopamine-high, which will encourage me to read more books.
I'll also make an effort to keep the books close to my face or in locations from which I can easily see them.

### Question 9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
It would be nice if I used Instagram less.
I chose to hide the app rather than keep it on the home screen to make accessing it more difficult.
I put a password to the app to make opening it more challenging or unappealing.
To create further friction between me and the app, I have disabled the notification feature.
