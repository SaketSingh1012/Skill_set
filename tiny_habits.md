### Question 1:

* In order to get to the venue of the event, the speaker had to depart the wine region early.
* The emphasis is on starting with little tasks rather than setting high standards.
* The speaker uses the practice of flossing one tooth each day to illustrate the concept.
* Focusing on little behaviors is the key to achieving big change.
* Small changes can have a big impact on one's life.

### Question 2:

* Creating new habits requires an understanding of the behavior equation: behavior = motivation + ability + cue.
* Establish little, quick habits to start with so you don't need as much encouragement to follow them.
* Action prompts that are triggered by a behavior's accomplishment are more effective than external or internal prompts.
* Celebrate each minor success by adding a little "shine" to your habit to boost your inspiration and motivation.
* The ability to adapt and perform more or return to the simplest version is crucial for habit maintenance. Small, persistent habits are most successful.

### Question 3: Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?

After each habit is successfully completed, "shining" or celebrating is important because it promotes positive behavior and offers various advantages that are critical for habit building.

### Question 4: What was the most interesting story or idea for you?

British Cycling's success was fueled by incremental improvements thanks to Dave Brailsford's "1% better" attitude. Small habits add up: 1% everyday success leads to considerable success, while failure stems from decline. Designing your surroundings for positive habits will help you change your behavior. A good place to start is with the "two-minute rule." Immediate rewards help preserve routines; employ the "Seinfeld strategy" to take pleasure in the journey.

### Question 5: What is the book's perspective about Identity?
* We believe in identity.
* The majority of people attempt to proceed from identity to outcome rather than outcome to identity.
* When a habit becomes a part of who we are, that is the pinnacle of intrinsic drive.
* When we resolve issues in order to get goals and results, we do so transiently.
* However, we need to update our identities as we resolve issues at the system level over a longer period of time.

### Question 6: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
* Make excellent behaviors visible and cultivate an environment that encourages them.
* Make it appealing and try to use dopamine, which is known to help us stick to things, to your benefit.
* Lessen the resistance you feel toward your beneficial practices.
* Provide rewards right away to send dopamine spikes to our brains.

### Question 7: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
* Make it harder to practice or maintain harmful habits.
* Make an action appear unsightly or nasty.
* Make an effort to fight your undesirable habits more often.
* The reward must be delayed and unsatisfactory.

### Question 8: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
I'd like to make reading books a habit.
I'll aim to read books about my favorite subject first because doing so will immediately make my brain feel dopamine-high, which will encourage me to read more books.
I'll also make an effort to keep the books close to my face or in locations from which I can easily see them.

### Question 9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
It would be nice if I used Instagram less.
I chose to hide the app rather than keep it on the home screen to make accessing it more difficult.
I put a password to the app to make opening it more challenging or unappealing.
To create further friction between me and the app, I have disabled the notification feature.
