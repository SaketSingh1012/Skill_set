## What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

Focused Thinking (Active Mode): This thinking style demands concentrated and diligent mental effort as you immerse yourself in a particular task or problem. It's characterized by an intense and purposeful focus, commonly applied when acquiring new knowledge or resolving intricate challenges.

Diffuse Thinking (Diffused Mode): In contrast, this mode is more relaxed and grants your mind the freedom to wander without a specific target. It's a state of mind where your attention isn't actively fixated on a particular task. Diffuse thinking often sparks creativity, fosters connections between ideas, and yields valuable insights. It also serves as an essential mode for comprehending complex concepts, allowing your brain to quietly process information in the background.
