# Question 1: Summary
# Answer:
Achieving success isn't just about being smart; it's about working hard and staying motivated. Key factors for success include determination, passion, and the ability to keep going. Doing well in school and graduating often comes down to having a strong will to succeed. Having a "growth mindset," which means believing you can improve, can help build this determination. It's not enough to rely solely on talent; you have to be ready to learn from your failures to develop the grit needed for success.

# Question 2: Summary
# Answer:
The concept of a growth mindset, introduced by Carol Dweck, is changing how we think about success in education. It involves two types of mindsets: the growth mindset (belief in developing abilities through effort) and the fixed mindset (belief that abilities are innate). People with a growth mindset see their talents as something they can improve, and they prioritize learning and development, leading to greater achievements. Your mindset affects how you view effort, challenges, failures, and feedback â€“ those with a growth mindset see these as opportunities to learn. To foster effective learning, it's essential to promote a growth mindset, as people's beliefs and focus can change over time.
