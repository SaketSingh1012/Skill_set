# Question 2: Summary
# Answer:
Growth mindset, developed by Carol Dweck, is revolutionizing education and learning by highlighting the significance of attitudes for achievement.
There are two mindsets: development (believing abilities are acquired through effort) and fixed (believing abilities are innate).
The fundamental tenet is that people with a growth mindset view their talents as pliable and place a strong emphasis on learning and development, which results in higher accomplishments.
People's attitudes toward effort, difficulties, failures, and criticism are influenced by their perspective; people with a growth mindset view these things as opportunities for learning.
For a culture of efficient learning, it is vital to create a growth mindset because the mindset can vary over time and differs by beliefs and focus.
